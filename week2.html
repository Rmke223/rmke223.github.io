    <p>What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?
    </p>
    
    <p>I have enjoyed pseudo coding. It certainly helps me organize all of the jumbled thoughts bouncing around in my head. The freedom of thinking through your project without being burdened down by making your code work, really helps me better understand what I really want to code to do. .</p>

    <p>What are you struggling with?</p>
    <p>Currently I am struggling most with recalling HTML and CSS elements and declarations. I feel like I am wasting a lot of time having to go back to w3 as often as I do. I believe this will get better with more repetition!</p>

    <p>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</p>
    <p>I am eager to learn more about JavaScript.  In the past I have really struggled with implementing JavaScript. I feel that I am more prepared to tackle Java now that I have more background knowledge. </p>
