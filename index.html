          <p>I am probably one of the last people you would imagine becoming a coder. I graduated from the University of Kentucky with a BS in Kinesiology. My time at UK consisted of collegiate Lacrosse, questionable decisions and occasional studying. After school I accepted a teaching/coaching position in Macon, Ga. I spent three years in the education field. I slowly found out that teaching was not for me. This led me to research career change options, eventually landing me here in front of this computer creating this blog page.</p> <p>*CAUTION* I STINK AT WRITING! Bear with me =D</p>
