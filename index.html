      <h2>Introduction</h2>
          Welcome to my first ever blog! My name is Ryan Kelly and I am embarking on a transformative journey. Yes, I am diving head first into the world of coding.  I have chosen to start this journey with the great team at Awesome Inc. in Lexington KY. As I progess through the Bootcamp program I will be posting a weekly blog. STAY TUNED!!!

      Who am I?    
      </h2>
     
          I am probably one of the last people you would imagine becoming a coder. I graduated from the University of Kentucky with a BS in Kinesiology. My time at UK consisted of collegiate Lacrosse, questionable decisions and occasional studying. After school I accepted a teaching/coaching position in Macon, Ga. I spent three years in the education field. I slowly found out that teaching was not for me. This led me to research career change options, eventually landing me here in front of this computer creating this blog page. <p>*CAUTION* I STINK AT WRITING! Bare with me =D</p>
